Training data structure - <START:corp> DATA <END>
Corpus Algorightm
For each line in training file
Find nth position of "<START:cop" where corp ={"habit","procedure","diagnosis","drug","vital"}
remaining_line -> line_substring [n:end of line]
extract the corpus data 
corp_data -> substring_of _remaining_line[startpos:endpos] where startpos = index of ">" in string remainig_line +1, endpos = index of "<" in string remainin_lin
remove leading and trailing spaces

Removing duplicate entry and store in corpus file
create a list of seen lines; line_seen.
read line from corpus_temp file,
if line is not in line_seen,
write in corpus file
add in the list of line_seen
end
